_(Include breakdown: initial planning, coding, testing, styling, etc.)_

## Development Process

### What Took the Most Time?

[Briefly describe the most challenging aspects, e.g., distance calculations, implementing drag interactions, getting the projection right, styling, etc.]

### Key Challenges

1. **[Challenge 1]**: [Description]
2. **[Challenge 2]**: [Description]
3. **[Challenge 3]**: [Description]

## Technical Implementation

### Design Choices

- **Circles vs Sliders**: Chose sliders over draggable edges for simplicity and clarity
- **Color Scheme**: Blue and orange circles for visual distinction, following modern UI patterns
- **Tooltip Design**: Comprehensive information display with clear sections for readability

### Performance Optimizations

- Efficient filtering using Haversine distance formula
- D3's data binding for smooth updates
- Single rendering pass for all data points
